# Guild Bank

Our goal is to offer a guild banking system that is practical, transparent, fair, and sustainable. The guild bank is managed by Shaday, the official guild quartermaster and enchanter.

## Bank Tabs

Our guild bank is currently organized into four tabs. They're all fully visible to all guildies, but they have varying rules in how items are deposited and withdrawn. The one major rule that applies to all tabs is that items may not be withdrawn for the purpose of selling them.

**Mutual Aid**  
Available to all guildies to take and deposit items such as rep items, tomes, green gems (which you can use in your raiding gear if you can't afford blues), green low cost recipes, earlier tradeskill items for skilling up, and lower cost blue and purple BOE items donated for guildie use.

**Commissary**  
Available to Banda and above, this tab contains consumable items for raiding. If you take a stack of something, deposit a stack of something or deposit some gold in exchange. You can also donate greens and blues for disenchanting, but mail those directly to Shaday instead of placing them in the guild bank. Examples include putting in a stack of food (20/stack) and taking a few stacks of mana pots (5/stack) etc. Donate what coincides with your skills or preference -- if you fish, donate fish, if you herb, donate some herbs, etc. This is a communal sharing space and it will only stay full if we contribute when we withdraw items.

**Trade goods**  
Available to Banda and above. Raw tradeskill items, cloth, raw meat/fish, herbs, primals, engineering items and metals, leather, green enchanting materials etc. Higher end items such as spellcloth etc, hardened adamantite, etc. can be borrowed and paid back in kind or items can be used for resist sets or other raid-required items. This tab will be managed such that herbs will be combined for pots and raw food items into stat food, which will then be placed in Commissary. Raw tradeskill items not in use may be sold by the guild quartermaster for guild gold to manage inventory and purchase items for consumables.

**Council**  
Available to officers, and reserved for expensive raiding gear and consumables. Resist gear sets and gems for resist sets, mana thistle for raid cauldrons, blue gems to assist people required to have 2 fully gemmed and enchanted raid gear sets. Rare and epic recipes higher cost green recipes, rare/epic enchanting materials. High cost rare/epic BOE items. Items from this tab are available upon request, although particularly expensive ones may need more than 1 officer approval. When in doubt, ask.
