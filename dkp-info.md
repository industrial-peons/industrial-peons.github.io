# DKP Info

**\<Industrial Peons\> uses a modified DKP auction system for 40 man raids, designed to discourage hoarding while ensuring no upgrade ever rots.**

Our system was chosen after Peons voted to have a DKP system, but with many also leaning towards a loot council system. To reconcile this, aspect of loot council have been incorporated into our DKP in the form of "priority classes/specs" for different items.

## How DKP Is Awarded

### Raids

We issue different DKP values depending on whether the raid in question is _progression,_ _current,_ or _old._

- A raid is considered a _progression_ raid if it is the hardest available raid and we have yet to kill its final boss. Progression raids award **5 DKP per boss kill**, as well as **5 DKP per raiding hour** as hazard pay.
- Once we kill the final boss of the most difficult currently available raid, that raid changes from _progression_ to _current._ Current raids still award **5 DKP per boss kill**, but no longer award the hazard pay.
- Once a guild is no longer the hardest guild for the current phase, it becomes _old._ An old raid only awards **2 DKP per boss kill**, and old raids are periodically circulated out of our DKP system and replaced with GDKPs and soft res PUGs.

We also have attendance modifiers for raids:

- **5 DKP** will be awarded for being present in the raid before the first pull.
- **60 DKP** will be given as a seed to new guild members at the end of their first raid.

### World Bosses

While the Peons are not a part of any official world boss coalition, we do try to actively join in with them for world boss kills. Each world boss attempt is worth **3 DKP**, regardless of if we kill the boss.

### Peonbank Weekly Quest

To help improve the resources available to the guild through the guild bank, additional DKP is available to members who complete the weekly guild quest. This guild quest can be completed in either a gold donation or by joining a guild farming session (such as a trash farm for valuable BOEs to sell), and comes in three tiers:

- **Tier 1: 8 DKP.** Hitting tier 1 requires a **25g** donation, or **1 hour** of guild farming activity.
- **Tier 2: 12 DKP.** Hitting tier 2 requires a **50g** donation, or **2 hours** of guild farming activity.
- **Tier 3: 15 DKP.** Hitting tier 3 requires a **100g** donation, or **3 hours** of guild farming activity.

Only the highest eligible tier will apply, and the Peonbank weekly quest resets every Saturday at noon.

## How DKP Is Spent

**We use MonolithDKP**. All guild members who raid should have it, and keep it up to date. It can be downloaded at [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/monolith-dkp](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/monolith-dkp) or with any number of WoW addon managers, such as WoWUp. Having this installed lets you view the full DKP data, although raiders who aren't officially in the guild might have difficulties receiving sync data, due to addon permissions.

To check your DKP, simply install the addon and type `/dkp`. You may also type `!dkp` into a raid and every officer in the raid will PM you your DKP.

To bid on an item, simply wait until the master looter links it, and type:

`/ra !bid x`

Example bid: `/ra !bid 30`

To cancel a bid: `/ra !bid cancel`

_Note: you will not see up to date values until an officer broadcasts to you. So if you think yours isnâ€™t accurate, make a post in the #dkp-helpdesk channel on our Discord and an officer with DKP push permissions will help you._

### Per-item Priority Information

Item priorities are available on each individual raid's page. We agree on each priority table as a guild before each new content phase starts. We lock the priority sheet once the phase begins, but it can still be changed by a group vote.

The classes and specs listed next to the items are the priority. The order of the names have no bearing on the order, but bolding represents special priority over other classes listed.

- [Onyxia Loot Priority]({{site.baseurl}}/onyxia)
- [Molten Core Loot Priority]({{site.baseurl}}/molten-core)
- [Blackwing Lair Loot Priority]({{site.baseurl}}/bwl)
- [The Temple of Ahn'qiraj Loot Priority]({{site.baseurl}}/aq40)
- [Naxxramas Loot Priority]({{site.baseurl}}/naxx)

### Tank Gearing

The MT has forced priority on any tank gear deemed essential to raid progression by the officers. The OT has forced secondary priority. The MT and OT cannot refuse these upgrades, and pay either 20% of their current DKP or 20 DKP (whichever is greater) per item for them in all cases, possibly pushing them into the negatives. Classic WoWâ€™s raid encounters are balanced around the majority of outgoing raid damage being funneled through 1 person out of 39. It isnâ€™t hard to do the math. Guilds serious about progression gear up their tanks ASAP. We are no exception. Tank gear is generally loot council. Do not expect to bid on it.

### Automatic Priority Loosening

If an item that is currently locked under a priority ever goes for less than 40 DKP in one of our raids, it loses it opens up to the next priority tier. For instance, if an item with a bolded priority of rogues and a non-bolded priority of all physical classes goes for less than 40 DKP, it would lose the bolded priority. If it goes for under 40 DKP again, it would even lose the non-bolded priority.

### Selling Gear

Individuals are strictly prohibited from attempting to turn their DKP into gold in any way, shape or form, and are similarly prohibited from buying items from raid members.

### Other Loot Types

**Crafting recipes and materials** are considered guild property and are never bid on. They are either distributed via loot council, sold, or stored for later use. Such stored materials and recipes can be requested by members in good standing for no cost.

**Legendary drops** are loot council only. They can never be bid on, and will go specifically to the individuals who will provide the most obvious numerical advantage to our raids. i.e., Thunderfury will go to the MT first.

**Sidegrades:** Let DKP handle it. If somebody wins, they win, regardless of whoâ€™s bidding, or what theyâ€™re wearing.

**Quest Items:** For quest chains that require multiple items from raids, if a player has one of the items, all other individuals bidding DKP on the item must also have the item. For example, if Mature Black Dragon Sinew drops and some of the raiders have the Ancient Petrified Leaf and some don't, only raiders who do have it may bid.

### Auction Information

**For epic bind-on-pick-up equipment, the auction has two rounds:**

**Round 1:** All players will place bids using the syntax above. Once bids have stagnated, the Loot Master will end the rolls in an auction style fashion (Going once.. Going Twice... Sold to Cariad). This first round is restricted to main spec rolls, i.e., a hunter bidding on a bow would be main spec, whereas a warrior bidding on it would not; additionally, off-spec classes like DPS warriors cannot attempt to buy tank gear during this round. If the raidâ€™s officers decide that the MT/OT do not require tank gear, DPS warriors may be forced to take tank gear for an automatic 5 DKP, or if they are under 5 DKP, all of their remaining DKP. This effectively makes tank gear loot-council. If a player bids up another player for an item that they are not eligible for, the auction may start again from minimum bid. All bids on main spec items start at **20 DKP**.

**Round 2**: If there are no offers in the first round, a second round takes place. This round obeys the same bidding format as the first, except for two key differences: there are no priority restrictions (including main spec) in the second round, other than that the item be an upgrade for one of the playerâ€™s roles within the raids or PVP, and the minimum bid is **10 DKP**, or if they are under 10 DKP, all of their remaining DKP.

**If there are no offers on the second round, one of two things will happen:**

1. The item will be given to an enchanter to disenchant, and the result will be considered guild property

2. If the item is deemed an upgrade useful to progression appears to have been ignored due to hoarding, a player is chosen by the officers to receive this item based on whoever the item would be the largest upgrade for. This player is still charged 20% of their total DKP, rounded up.

### Negative DKP

A player cannot bid more DKP than they have. In the event a player reaches 0 DKP, they are forbidden from placing bids unless every other player with priority for an item also reaches 0 DKP, in which all players with priority on an item `/roll 100` for it, with the winner being charged **20 DKP** and pushed into the negatives.

### DKP Decay

On the first of every month, every player loses 20% of their current DKP, rounded up, to discourage hoarding.

## Recommended Addons

We highly recommend the following addons for raiding:

- **Monolith DKP** (otherwise you'll have to deal with getting your DKP whispered to you instead of being able to check it yourself!)
- **Deadly Boss Mods**
- **ClassicThreatMeter**
- **Details!**
- **WeakAuras**
- **HealComms** (healers only)
- **Peggle**

## Voting

This system is able to be changed by a vote of the raid-ready guild members. Please contact the raid officers if you would like to propose a vote, and we will post it in #ðŸ’°loot-discussion on the guild Discord. A vote requires at least 30 raid-ready Peons to vote either way on the proposed change, and changes cannot be made mid-raid.

If we encounter an unforeseen situation that seems outside the bounds of this system, the raid officers, while open to consultation from other players, will make the final decision in-raid.

## Non-guild Raiders

### Guest DKP Raiders

40 is a lot of people, and especially with the rapidly approaching reduction to 25-person raids, it's not always possible to make sure that everyone in the raid has an **\<Industrial Peons\>** guild tag. Non-guild members who raid with us regularly may request to be added to our DKP system, which will allow them to accrue and spend DKP at exactly the same rate as other members, including access to the **Peonbank weekly quest.** This option is particularly popular with members of RP guilds who enjoy raiding with us.

### PUGs

If we are unable to completely fill a raid with people in the Peons DKP system and need to resort to pulling in a few additional members on a one-off basis, the loot rules will slightly change when an item is dropped that the PUG member can use. Instead of auctioning the gear, the PUG and all eligible raiders will roll on the item, with main spec taking priority over off spec. If a PUG wins the roll, they get the item. Congratulations! If someone in the Peons DKP system wins the roll, the item immediately goes to DKP, and all eligible DKP-holding raiders can bid on it as normal.

When rolling, we also use a round robin system to ensure that main spec gear gets handed out as evenly as possible. If some of the PUGs rolling on a main spec item have won a main spec item and some haven't, priority will be given to PUG members who have won the least main spec items. **DKP-holding members are not governed by this rule, and may always roll on main spec.**
