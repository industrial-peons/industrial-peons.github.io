# Gruul's Lair and Magtheridon's Lair

![Peons proving that blood science is bullshit]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/mag.jpg)

Gruul and Magtheridon are cleared weekly, and use EP/GP for handling loot. When running Gruul and Magtheridon, we prioritize including members who are not part of the normally scheduled raid group, in order to make sure that everyone gets a chance to raid.
