# Welcome!

**We are a tight-knit, LGBTQIA+ friendly, pro-feminism, pro-racial equality, [pro-killing Kel'thuzad]({{site.baseurl}}/naxx/) raiding guild.**

We are currently using a DKP system to distribute loot. Additional information about our loot system can be found on the [DKP info]({{site.baseurl}}/dkp-info) page or in the #loot-information channel in our Discord!

We also periodically back up our DKP totals to the website. To see a recently updated DKP list, click [here]({{site.baseurl}}/dkp/).

## Raid Schedule

We run a weekly Naxxramas, split over Saturday and Monday. We will also periodically host 40-person PUGs in the Peon PUGs Discord on Thursday evenings. 20-person raids and Onyxia are hosted ad-hoc, and generally when enough of us are online with free time.
