# Welcome!

Welcome to the Peons! We're a leftist guild on the Grobbulus (PvP-RP) WoW Classic server, dedicated to fighting bigotry, capitalism, and the Burning Legion alike.

We are currently using EP/GP to distribute loot (although we used DKP in Classic, in case you come across any out of date references). Additional information about our loot system can be found on the [raid format]({{site.baseurl}}/raid-format) page or in the `#üíçloot-discussion` channel in our Discord!

We also periodically back up our EP/GP totals to the website. To see a recently updated EP/GP list (including fancy graphs!), click [here]({{site.baseurl}}/epgp_standings/).

## Raid Schedule

We do tier 5 content on Tuesdays and Thursdays (alternating which raid is on Tuesday and which is on Thursday every week), Gruul/Mag on Wednesdays, and Karazhan on Saturdays, Sunday, and Mondays.
