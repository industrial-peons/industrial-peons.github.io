# Welcome!

Welcome to the Peons! We're a leftist guild on the Grobbulus (PvP-RP) WoW Classic server, dedicated to fighting bigotry, capitalism, and the Burning Legion alike.

We are currently using EP/GP to distribute loot. Additional information about our loot system can be found on the [raid format]({{site.baseurl}}/raid-format) page or in the `#üíçloot-discussion` channel in our Discord!

We also periodically back up our EP/GP totals to the website. To see a recently updated EP/GP list (including fancy graphs!), click [here]({{site.baseurl}}/epgp_standings/).

## Raid Schedule

We raid Serpentshrine Cavern on Tuesdays, Gruul/Magtheridon on Wednesdays, The Eye on Thursdays, and Karazhan on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Monday is kept free as an overflow night in case our SSC or TE raid has to be cut short.

Or, in table form:

<div class="narrow-table">
