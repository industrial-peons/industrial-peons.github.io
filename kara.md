# Karazhan

![Peons making their way into the spooky tower]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/kara.png)

We run multiple Karazhan groups every week, with a lot of flexibility granted to each individual raid leader on how they want to run their raid. In general, these Karazhans will use a soft reserve, MS>OS system with two soft reserves per raider.

Karazhan runs do not award EP, and items that drop from Karazhan cannot be bid on using GP.
