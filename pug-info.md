# Peon Pug Loot System

## Zul'Gurub

**\<Industrial Peons\>** uses a soft reserve for items looted within Zul'Gurub.

### Soft Reserving

Place your name next to one piece of gear on this document provided by the raid leader.

- This document will be locked right before the first boss. It will only be edited if a new player joins the raid after the first boss.

If your name is the only one next to that item and it drops, you automatically win that item.
If there are 2+ names on that item and it drops, those names roll off for it and highest roll wins.
If there are no names next to that item, it will go to MS/OS, and the highest roll wins in that order.

If you win a MS roll, you will be lower priority for the next MS item you roll on. In other words, if you roll highest on your next MS item (after you won one already), the next highest roll (if any) will instead be given the item, and the system will reset from there.
OS rolls do not count towards any priority in loot. In other words, if you win an OS item, you are still free to roll on other MS/OS items until you win an MS item (see above point regarding MS items).
If no one rolls from MS/OS, it will go to open roll for the entire raid and highest roll wins.
Idols and Heart of Hakkar may or may not be reserved for the guild. This will be announced prior to starting the raid and again to any new players.

### Gathering Nodes and Hoodoo Piles

2 options
Option 1: all miners roll for RTVs and all herbalists roll for bloodvine nodes, and highest roll wins
Option 2: A dedicated miner/herbalist will mine all desired nodes. In the event of an arcane crystal/bloodvine dropping, it will go to open roll for the entire raid and highest roll wins.
Hoodoo Piles: need to figure this out

### Coins

All coins will go to open need roll for the entire raid and highest roll wins.

### Bijous

All bijous will go to open need roll for the entire raid and highest roll wins.

### BOE Trash Items

All BOE trash items will go to open need roll for the entire raid and highest roll wins.
