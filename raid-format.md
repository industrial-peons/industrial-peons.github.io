# Industrial Peons TBC Raid Format

**_Note: This document is considered to be the source of truth whenever it differs from the Google Doc.._**

Welcome to the Peons! We’re the queer-friendly commie underdogs of Grobbulus, dedicated to proving that you can be a successful raid team without enabling the most toxic elements in gaming.

We’re a democratically run guild, with votes on loot system and item priorities before every major content phase, and we elect our own guild leader. Our leadership core is 100% volunteer-based, with no benefits for being an officer other than a grisly view of how the sausage is made.

## Raid Expectations

In general, we have the following list of expectations for each raider:

- **First and foremost, attitude**. We take our nontoxic atmosphere seriously, so we have a _very_ strict “no gamer words” policy. We also might ask members to sit out if they start using personal attacks against other raiders, or otherwise take out frustration in unhealthy ways. We’re here because we love coming together as a community and playing games together, not because we’re trying to be the fastest on the server to kill Kil’jaeden.
- **In raid and voice 30 minutes before first pull**. Invites start at 45 minutes before first pull, and we start pulling members off the bench at 15 minutes before first pull.
- **Each raider is required to bring a full set of consumables**: elixirs/flask, food buff, weapon enchants (if applicable). We don’t require that raiders stay fully consumed for the entire time, but we will occasionally call for everyone to use their consumables for a tryhard boss attempt.
- **Our raids run from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM**. During times of difficult progression we appreciate people who can stay late, but we don’t expect it.
- **We expect raiders’ gear to be gemmed and enchanted**, with blue quality gems for DPS, and high green quality gems for healers (although blue quality gems are a big plus!). If you’re struggling with the gold costs, feel free to give a shout to any @Jewelcrafters or @Enchanters in our professions channel in Discord, or hit up our official guild enchanter, Shaday, to see what mats she has on hand.
- **We expect raiders to watch at least one video on each new raid** before we begin it, so that they have a general idea of what to do for boss fights. Raiders don’t need to have everything memorized and there’s no quiz, but we do them to, for example, come into Gruul knowing that staying away from other raiders is important.
- **Everyone raids, everyone sits**. In order to get as many Peons into raids as possible, we have a rotating bench system where most raiders will be benched every few raids, depending on role. More information on how the bench works can be found in the **Bench EP** section.

## Raid schedule

We raid every Tuesday (and Thursday, once P2 begins) at 6:00 PM server time, with Monday as a dedicated cleanup day and Karazhan runs spread throughout the week. Signups for 10-player raids go out every Sunday night, and 25-player rosters go out every Monday.

## EP/GP rules

### How EP is awarded

EP is awarded per boss kill in 25-player raids. We use the default values set by CEPGP, which start at 15 EP for High King Maulgar and go up to 24 EP for Kil’jaeden. No EP is awarded for 10-player raids or anything in vanilla.

Unlike in Classic, we will no longer be awarding an on-time bonus. We expect all raiders to either be in the raid on time, or to have communicated with their respective point-of-contact before the raid. If you are not in the raid 15 minutes before first pull (and you haven’t already discussed this with an officer and gotten the go-ahead to be late), your spot risks being given to someone on the bench. A repeated pattern of absences might jeopardize your spot in the main rotation.

During progression, each player in the raid and on the bench is also awarded an amount of “hazard pay” EP equal to the EP value of the first boss in the raid, once per full hour of raiding as raid leaders see fit. Once the final boss of that raid has been killed at least once, no further hazard pay is awarded for that raid.

If the raid leadership asks a raider to switch which character they raid on, all EP and GP will transfer over between the two characters. We had originally planned to have characters accrue EP/GP separately when we were planning on having two raid teams, but now that we have a single raid team we will have EP/GP accrue on a per-raider basis instead, provided it’s been cleared with the raid leadership first.

#### Bench EP

It is well understood that real life often throws curve balls and that raiders may not be able to make it. Any raiders who are attuned to the night's raid but not scheduled for it may sit on the bench by whispering `!standby` to the raid's loot master from their main. Sitting on the bench rewards *100% EP,* and as of October 2021 no longer requires staying in voice. While sitting the bench you must remain available over either in-game chat or Discord DMs. If we ask you to come in off the bench and you decline or give no response within 5 minutes, you will be removed from the bench. Any EP earned before that moment will be kept, but no further EP will be earned for that night's raid.

### How GP is accrued

GP is accrued (“spent”) to buy items from raid bosses that give EP. We will determine custom GP values at the beginning of the phase based on actual use of items. For phase 1, we are using default GP values for each item except Dragonspine Trophy, which we’ve increased from 101 to 202 GP.

There are three levels of bids that can be placed on items: major upgrade, minor upgrade, and greed. Major upgrade bids cost 100% of the item’s base GP, and take priority over all other types of bids. Minor upgrade bids cost 50% of the item’s base GP, and take priority over off-spec bids. Greed bids cost 10% of the item’s base GP, and are the lowest priority bid.

#### Flex

Flex is a special priority level for people who are asked by raid leaders to respec. To make a flex bid, you must be in your non-standard spec (for instance, prot when you usually raid as arms). If an item drops that would be an upgrade your flex set, any greed bid you make will gain priority over other greed bids, and if you win the item you will be awarded it for free.

#### Unwanted items

Non-tier items that receive no bids will be disenchanted by guild enchanters, and their materials will be put into the guild bank. Since tier gear is more difficult to disenchant than other forms of gear, any tier gear that gets no bids will be rolled out among people who want it for off-spec, at no cost. Flex (see above) takes priority over these rolls.

#### Weekly decay

Every Tuesday, after the reset but before the raid, EP decays by 20% and GP decays by 25%. This means that new raiders will come up to speed with current raiders in a little over ten weeks, and that gear purchases become negligible (less than 10% of originally paid cost) after eight weeks.

20% weekly EP decay may seem high to raiders who were with us during Classic, when we used DKP, but EP isn’t cash in the same way DKP is. It’s not spent at any time, so the decay is the only way that it can go down. A 20% weekly decay means it will take 10 lockouts to get close enough to the EP soft cap for government work, at which point GP is really the only thing that matters.

(We won’t actually be giving out exactly 100 EP per week, but it makes graphing easier)

#### Item priority

We have two levels of item priority: bolded and non-bolded. Bolded priority has priority over non-bolded priority, which has priority over general bids. When an item drops, every member whose class/spec matches the bolded priority may make a major or minor bid. If none do, every member whose class/spec matches the non-bolded priority may make a major or minor bid. If none do, every member of the raid may make a major, minor, or greed bid.

Legendary items are all handled by loot council, and any BOE recipes and mats are considered guild property.

Item priorities are decided before each major content phase drops by a guild-wide meeting. The officers will prepare an initial list of suggested loot prios, based off which classes and item is most useful to, from both a BIS standpoint and an overall raid health standpoint. Once this list of suggested loot prios is generated, guild members are able to discuss specific suggested priorities in it, and vote on ones where there’s no clear consensus.

#### Automatic priority loosening

If an item with a prio drops and receives no major upgrade bids, it goes down one level of priority. For instance, if an item with a bolded priority of rogues and a non-bolded priority of warriors receives no major upgrade bids, rogues lose their bolded prio (so it can be bid on equally by rogues and warriors). If it drops again and still receives no major upgrade bids, it would lose all prios.

#### Bidder’s Remorse

We’re all getting used to EP/GP, so for the duration of phase 1 we’ll be offering free backsies if you win an item then realize it’s not actually good for you. Although the backsies will be refunded in GP, you may still face the embarrassment of the raid - so be conscious of the items that you need for major/minor/greed before the raid! Starting in phase 2 we’ll continue to offer backsies, but at a GP cost equal to a greed bid (10%).
